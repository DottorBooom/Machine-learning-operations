## Introduction

+ This course is shared with another master's degree in engineering, which is why the name on the slide does not correspond to that of the repository. The course will be divided into 3 parts, where the first will be an explanation of Python.
+ In this course we would only follow the second and third parts that will be on software engeneering and machine learning.
+ It will be entirely in English, slides made by the professor on which I will take notes lesson after lesson.
+ The final exam will consist of a group project that have to be presented to the professor.

### What you will learn

+ Know the principles and techniques of the design and implementation of an Information System
+ Acquire the ability to design an information system, use independently the techniques and tools learned
+ Represent and display the knowledge learned using Machine Learning principles
+ Interpret and independently learn the evolution of methodologies and apply new techniques and design tools

### Common rules & principles

+ Every question is **legitimate and useful**, ask what you do not understand
+ Main pourpose it to **learn**, not to grade
+ Learning is a **process**, not a result
+ Nobody is perfect or always right: **errors and mistake are natural**
+ **Learning is a process in our personal brain**, not in other's one. **Clash with your limits** before check the solution
